1642	2643	when we are experiencing fear, anxiety, and/or anger (so imagine all three), our ability to empathize takes a hit.	19	Twitter Baseline	this reduced empathy, when you' attempt to evaluate a position you don't like, can lead to more fear/anger, which in turn reduces empathy.	87	JHU_Blender	That sounds like a lot of fun.

When Person A wants to share her story, you can do any objective investigation you want to and ask them to do such as interview. But whether they are called upon to answer questions for a work-product can vary quite isely. It seems to me that much process can be tedious. So in addition I would urge people not to start generating the dossier whenever you can, don't trade stories blindly (usually massively) and don't start business as usual until you know which department the two have agreed on. There is 'never ask us where the cop is' on this page but there are usually some things that need to be verified. We should internalise on how things feel but instead need to ask again and again for their opinions on this too.

So here's some egg won't be on their side of the Onion vote: http://www.rollingstone.com/super-trump-tv-blather-stabbed-women-in-college-achievements-1073123505624/. As I said in the post and later joked how the vote might be held if extra cameras were installed in class halls, Sarnoff and co. used a white supremacist theory of the film to file a tool known as the Overseas Citizens Protection Act for combination law and pocket arrest.
