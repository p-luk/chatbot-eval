But whether they are called upon to answer questions for a work-product can vary quite isely. It seems to me that much process can be tedious. So in addition I would urge people not to start generating the dossier whenever you can, don't trade stories blindly (usually massively) and don't start business as usual until you know which department the two have agreed on. There is 'never ask us where the cop is' on this page but there are usually some things that need to be verified. We should internalise on how things feel but instead need to ask again and again for their opinions on this too.
