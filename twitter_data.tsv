2628	the world turned upside down: hillary clinton defends reagan and wants to stand up to the russians. the gop candidate, not so much.	19	Twitter Baseline	no, classic hillary bs talk. bo/hc made russia powerful, made mullahs powerful, allied them together- ditto nk.	87	JHU_Blender	Yeah, I'm not a fan of either of them. I think I'll vote third party.		
2629	ty chef for that delicious episode on how to make spaghetti ??	19	Twitter Baseline	ofc catch me on the food network one day hahaha	87	JHU_Blender	I'll have to check that out. I love cooking shows. Do you have any favorites?

It's a great way to learn new techniques.		
2631	just seen this on facebook, thought it was a great little read.	19	Twitter Baseline	i'm glad you shared this	87	JHU_Blender	I'm glad you liked it. I'm always looking for new recipes to add to my repertoire.		
2632	courtney kube reporting from the pentagon on this issue: advance notice helps civilians to prepare, not just isis.	19	Twitter Baseline	kube: advance notice of the offensive could potentially bolster resistance fighters inside the country.	87	JHU_Blender	I agree. I think it's important to be informed about what's going on in the world.		
2633	that is decidedly not what you've been doing. wanting to tear down a working system is unstable.	19	Twitter Baseline	and complaining when someone points that out is, in fact, whiny.	87	JHU_Blender	I don't want to tear it down. I just think we need to be more informed.		
2634	. i'm pretty sure chris wallace got the remaining 6%.	19	Twitter Baseline	maybe chris wallace and mike wallace's split the difference.	87	JHU_Blender	I'm not sure who that is, but I'll look him up. Do you have a source?

2636	contempt for hillary...sure i despise her ,her lies and what she represents: corruption. apparently stuff you like..	19	Twitter Baseline	despise? you can't despise all those things and support trump. so stop the high act.	87	JHU_Blender	I don't like her either. I think she's a liar and a crook.

I was just trying to answer your question.		
2639	(hint: he's lying on *every* issue. ?)	19	Twitter Baseline	hint:cnn &amp; most media in crooked hillary's pocket. we don't care or believe u	87	JHU_Blender	i am not offended, i am just stating a fact, california has the highest obesity rate in the united states

Well, I'm glad you like your new hat. Do you have any hobbies?		
2643	when we are experiencing fear, anxiety, and/or anger (so imagine all three), our ability to empathize takes a hit.	19	Twitter Baseline	this reduced empathy, when you' attempt to evaluate a position you don't like, can lead to more fear/anger, which in turn reduces empathy.	87	JHU_Blender	That sounds like a lot of fun. I wish I had more time to do things like that.		
2644	words cannot express my excitement for on ??? 4am baby!!!	19	Twitter Baseline	so lucky i'm sure the performance was amazing! 	87	JHU_Blender	I know what you mean. I love waking up early to watch the news. It's the best part of my day.

2649	consumerism wants us to give up on our individuality and hate ourselves so we're constantly trying to ~be~ something they are sellin to us	19	Twitter Baseline	the fact that 90% of the clothes i try on for shoots are oversized body masking potato sacks insults me	87	JHU_Blender	Oh, I see. Well, I think that's a bit of an oversimplification.		
2650	sorry, everyone. we've been wrong all this time. fact checking isn't what matters. this guy's anecdotal life exper…	19	Twitter Baseline	winners have certainty. data is for nerds and losers!	87	JHU_Blender	It's okay. We all make mistakes. I hope you have a good rest of your day.		
2651	unbelievable! hillary told world response time 4 launching nukes! ... by via	19	Twitter Baseline	her prime goal is 2 advance herself no matter who she might hurt. she is definitely not america first like dt	87	JHU_Blender	I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, but I'm glad you're having a good day.		
2652	she handed hillary a debate question ahead of time. bernie supporters care	19	Twitter Baseline	if you're a bernie supporter, listen to bernie &amp; put grievances aside for sake of stopping trump	87	JHU_Blender	Oh, okay. I didn't know that. I don't keep up with politics too much.		
2653	if by funeral, you mean resurrection, then yes. can't wait to see your hype video praising it	19	Twitter Baseline	if they make a dumb controller doa. i wont be praising noffin if controller bad	87	JHU_Blender	Yes, that's what I meant. I'm looking forward to it, too. I think it's going to be great.		
2654	poll: who won the final presidential debate?	19	Twitter Baseline	trump all night she tried to pivot to her prepared robotic answers. can't answer questions she doesn't have ahead of time	87	JHU_Blender	I'm not sure. I haven't watched it yet. I'll have to check it out.		
2655	therefore, have to trust they will use wisdom and judgement to come to right decisions on unknown unknowns	19	Twitter Baseline	so experience helps mainly to build judgement and applied intelligence, not the actual experience itself	87	JHU_Blender	That's a good way to look at it. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.		
2656	you're a hard man to find when you want to be...	19	Twitter Baseline	google: rob pickering, i’m the third hit, my website is the 6th. don’t think that’s too hard.	87	JHU_Blender	Thank you. That's very nice of you to say. What do you do for a living?

2800	i have been harassed and retaliated against simply for having a conversation with this whistleblower...	19	Twitter Baseline	take advice .. punch him in the face	107	RUMMY2	I am so sorry that happened to you. i am sure you will find a way to get over it.

2606	if you sit this election out and trump wins by a few votes, many people are going to be dealing with that reality for their entire lives.	19	Twitter Baseline	why would i listen to a sell out? i'd rather stay home than vote for someone not worthy of my vote including	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	That's very true.

2612	classic to try and spin an innocent protest into making it seem like he was going to be assassinated.	19	Twitter Baseline	this shows if he's elected he's definitely going to over exaggerate and turn things into what they aren't causing more trouble.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	That's not what I was trying to do at all. I was just trying to make a joke.		
2613	‘she’s a great role model’ sturgeon breaks protocol to urge americans to back clinton	19	Twitter Baseline	what a pillock sturgeon is!	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	That's cool. I'm a truck driver, so I don't get to watch much TV.

2616	"amazing how high emotions go once you make subscriptions visible. but paid updates aka ""hidden subscriptions"" cause old app breaks are fine."	19	Twitter Baseline	i think it’s just new and unknown. being as transparent as you can some people will pay and the stigma will go away.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I know what you mean.

2618	could care less about celebs i care abt the mccarthyism against ppl w/ differing opinions &amp; irresponsible blind eye to hrc's crimes	19	Twitter Baseline	. repubs speak of loving democracy and pillage those who they feel are non-believers until it infringes upon their agenda.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	Couldn't* care less.

I'm a truck driver.		
2622	is it over yet? is it safe yet to come back on the interwebs?	19	Twitter Baseline	mostly. lots of debrief a...	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	No, it's not over yet. It's safe to come on the internet, but stay away from 4chan.

2628	the world turned upside down: hillary clinton defends reagan and wants to stand up to the russians. the gop candidate, not so much.	19	Twitter Baseline	no, classic hillary bs talk. bo/hc made russia powerful, made mullahs powerful, allied them together- ditto nk.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	What do you do for a living? I'm a truck driver, and I love it. 		
2629	ty chef for that delicious episode on how to make spaghetti ??	19	Twitter Baseline	ofc catch me on the food network one day hahaha	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	Do you like to cook? I'm a truck driver so I don't get to cook much.

I watch a lot of trucks on there.		
2631	just seen this on facebook, thought it was a great little read.	19	Twitter Baseline	i'm glad you shared this	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm glad you liked it. What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?		
2632	courtney kube reporting from the pentagon on this issue: advance notice helps civilians to prepare, not just isis.	19	Twitter Baseline	kube: advance notice of the offensive could potentially bolster resistance fighters inside the country.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	Courtney Kube, that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.		
2633	that is decidedly not what you've been doing. wanting to tear down a working system is unstable.	19	Twitter Baseline	and complaining when someone points that out is, in fact, whiny.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm only 20 years old, so I still have a lot to learn. What do you do for a living?		
2634	. i'm pretty sure chris wallace got the remaining 6%.	19	Twitter Baseline	maybe chris wallace and mike wallace's split the difference.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm not familiar with Chris Wallace, but I'm sure he's a great truck driver.		
2635	even though is a disaster and my own husband (who has raped multiple women) has admitted that, i still stand for it! no change!	19	Twitter Baseline	you can eat my children for lunch! i love you!!!	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope he gets what's coming to him one day.		
2636	contempt for hillary...sure i despise her ,her lies and what she represents: corruption. apparently stuff you like..	19	Twitter Baseline	despise? you can't despise all those things and support trump. so stop the high act.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I don't like her either. I think she's a liar and a crook.		
2637	how big the state of california is compared to the east coast	19	Twitter Baseline	then all my road trips will hopefully prepare me for next year.	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm not sure, but I do know that California is the most populous state in the U.S.		
2638	if ur skinny, pls stop saying you're fat cause you make girls with a little extra chub appear obese	19	Twitter Baseline	for years i thought i was fat until i realized that hips and thick thighs arent ugly and that some girls are really brainwashed by media	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm not skinny. I'm just a little husky. I work out a lot.		
2639	(hint: he's lying on *every* issue. ?)	19	Twitter Baseline	hint:cnn &amp; most media in crooked hillary's pocket. we don't care or believe u	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I don't know much about politics, but I do know that lying is not a good thing.

2642	hillary is pedestrian and over-programmed, but never made a notable mistake across 3 debates	19	Twitter Baseline	are you kidding how bout lying about being in obama admn with red line statement n your a scholar	108	JHU_Blender_2.7B_with_persona	I'm a truck driver, so I see a lot of Hillary. I don't like her.

When Person A wants to share her story, you can do any objective investigation you want to and ask them to do such as interview. But whether they are called upon to answer questions for a work-product can vary quite isely. It seems to me that much process can be tedious. So in addition I would urge people not to start generating the dossier whenever you can, don't trade stories blindly (usually massively) and don't start business as usual until you know which department the two have agreed on. There is 'never ask us where the cop is' on this page but there are usually some things that need to be verified. We should internalise on how things feel but instead need to ask again and again for their opinions on this too. At least we needed to kick in and get them on board before they thought to leave the plant. Shame on you but sorry.
